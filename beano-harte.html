            The Beano Harte tournament is an U13 camogie tournament run by the club in memory of 2 prominent club members that passed away in recent years, Brian 'Beano' Cullen and Shaunagh Harte. It is run every June bank holiday Monday across all the clubs pitches. There is an A competition and a B competition.

            Below are some of the key considerations for the incoming under 13 mentors in running the tournament.
         </p>
         <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pitches and facilities</strong> – In January reach out to the pitches and facilities co-ordinator to ensure all the pitches are booked for the June bank holiday Saturday and also that the hall is available from the Friday to Saturday evening.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Trophies and medals</strong> – In February or March reach out to the previous year's winners to ensure you get the 2 cups back on time for cleaning. You will also need to order medals for every player. Usually gold for winners, silver for runners up and bronze for everyone else in both competitions.
                </li>
                <br>    
                <li>
                    <strong>Catering</strong> – You will need to form a catering committee of parents in May that will look after the co-ordination of setting up the hall to cater lunch for all the teams and ensuring all families supply a good range of sandwiches, cakes and biscuits.
                </li>
                <br>    
                <li>
                    <strong>Fund raising</strong> – Plan at least 2 fundraisers early in the year to raise money for the tournament and for gear for the teams. This usually includes a top, shorts, socks for every player. The gear is usually presented in the club before the tournament.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Inviting teams</strong> – In January reach out to the mentor contact in your 13 or 14 target clubs and once they confirm interest follo wup with formal invite. WCC usually enters a team in the A competition and the B competition.
                </li>
                <br>
               <li>
                    <strong>Referees</strong> – In April reach out to the camogie referee co-ordinator in county board and put him on notice that you are looking for 5 referees for the tournament. They will usually follow up in mid May to confirm names.
                </li>
                <br>
