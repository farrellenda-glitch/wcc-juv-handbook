            Being a member of the club is a requirement for all those looking to take part in the activities of Whitehall Colmcille.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            Only paid up members will be registered, with the club and their relevant county board. Any player who has not paid the appropriate playing membership subscription will not be permitted to train or play matches - as they are not covered in any way in the event of an injury. All mentors and co-ordinators must be paid up members of the Club. Link for membership below.
