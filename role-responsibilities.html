            All mentors should ensure that young people and children benefit significantly from our games by providing a positive, healthy and encouraging ethos for all. In developing the skills levels of every player you should always encourage enjoyment, fun and participation in our games and activities. Coaches should always remember that they are role models for the players in their care.
