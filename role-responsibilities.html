            All mentors should ensure that young people and children benefit significantly from our games by providing a positive, healthy and encouraging ethos for all. In developing the skills levels of every player you should always encourage enjoyment, fun and participation in our games and activities. Coaches should always remember that they are role models for the players in their care.

            Please see the full Mentor's code of conduct linked below but the key points include:
         </p>
         <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adopt a child-centred approach</strong> – Promote enjoyment, participation, skill development and self-esteem while respecting every child equally, regardless of background or ability.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prioritise development over winning</strong> – Focus on improvement, learning and personal satisfaction rather than medals, trophies or competition outcomes.
                </li>
                <br>    
                <li>
                    <strong>Lead by example</strong> – Model respectful behaviour, promote Fair Play, avoid inappropriate language or substances, and support match officials and parental involvement.
                </li>
                <br>    
                <li>
                    <strong>Maintain safe and respectful conduct</strong> – Never use physical punishment, shouting or ridicule; ensure appropriate physical contact; build relationships based on trust and mutual respect; challenge bullying in all forms.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Protect boundaries</strong> – Avoid being alone with players, transporting them alone, individual texting, excessive one-to-one time, or situations that could compromise your role.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ensure best practice and player welfare</strong> – Maintain attendance and injury records, provide First Aid, prevent injured players from competing, ensure safe transport and communication, and maintain clean, safe facilities.
                </li>
