                    <li>• Understanding - What to do</li>
                    <li>• Confidence - The coach</li>
                    <li>• Reduces time that the players are not active</li>
                    <li>• Selecting appropriate activities</li>
                    <li>• Trust from parents</li>
                    <li>• Create goals for the player to achieve</li>
