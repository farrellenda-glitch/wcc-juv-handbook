            Below are some of the key considerations for incoming under 15 mentors in preparing for the tournaments.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Teams and panels</strong> – Each Féile competition has specific rules around naming fixed panels and the use of underage players. Please make sure all mentors understand these rules in detail.
                </li>
                <br>      
                <li>
                    <strong>Fund raising</strong> – It is usual to have a fundraiser before Christmas or early in the year to raise money for Féile gear for your teams. This usually includes a top, shorts and socks for every player. A presentation of gear is organised by mentors prior to the first games.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hosting finals day/full blitz</strong> – The club may be asked or offered to host the finals day/or full blitz day. This will require much of the organisation details under PJ Troy and Beano Harte.
