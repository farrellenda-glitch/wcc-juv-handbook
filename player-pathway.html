            The Gaelic Games Player Pathway is designed around a set of principles that align with the core values of the GAA, the LGFA & Camogie Associations, ensuring opportunities for everyone to experience Gaelic Games whilst providing the very best, most valid development experiences possible for all of our players. The Player Pathway is based on international best practice. It consists of three main pathway phases; Foundation, Talent and Elite/High Performance which in turn, are further sub-divided into eight sub-phases. The pathway is not linear with the players connection with their club maintained even if they play at inter-county level.
