            The club has adopted the GAA Code of Best Practice in Youth Sport. This policy booklet outlines best
            practice in relation to all interaction with children (includes all under 18 year olds). In relation to the
            taking of photographs parents are asked each year upon registration to inform team mentors if they do
            not want their child included in club photographs. This can now be done through the Foireann System. The following are some other key considerations in relation to taking team photos and videos.

                <li>Parental consent as outlined above is essential and how images and videos are to be used should be clear.</li>
                <li>If a match is being photographed or videoed then opposition consent is also required and content shared.</li>
                <li>Images and videos should focus on the team and activity not individual children.</li>
                <li>Never capture images or video that would be considered compromising or embarassing.</li>
                <li>Only use images and video for legitimate club purposes such as match reports and promotion.</li>
                <li>Never include personal details such as address, school or any contact information.</li>
                <li>Store all images and video securely with limited access.</li>
                <li>If using a third party ensure they are club-approved and understand club policies re. safeguarding.</li>
                <li>If someone unknown is taking photos video at a juvenile event, officials should be made aware and their purpose politely checked.</li>
                <li>Any content sharing via social media needs to be monitored carefully for inappropriate interaction/comment.</li>
                <li>If a parent or young person objects to photos or video being taken at any stage this must be fully respected.</li>
                <li>If you want to video a match involving Under 18s you need Dublin County Board and opposition approval.</li>
                <li>If you want to video a match involving Under 18s an unedited copy must be made available to Dublin County Board on request.</li>
