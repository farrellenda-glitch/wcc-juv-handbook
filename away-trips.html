            Away trips are of huge benefit to juvenile players and team bonding and are a very enjoyable aspect of their membership. However, the club has a duty to Dublin GAA and trips away can never be at the expense of our fixture obligations in the county. The following need to be considered when planning a trip.
        </p>
        <div class="p-4 sm:p-6">
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-left">
                <li>The relevent section secretary (GAA, Camogie, LGFA) needs to be consulted in advance of any decision to plan a trip. </li>
                <li>The trip must be authorised in advance by the Juvenile Commitee.</li>
                <li>Trips, matches cannot clash with official county board fixtures.</li>
                <li>Where possible all children on the panel should have the opportunity to go on all away trips. Where this is not possible - alternate trips should be arranged to include all children on the panel.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>  
        <p class="text-left">
            Coach/children ratios need to be adhered to. One adult for 8 children Under 12 and below - one adult per 10 children for Under 13 and above. To be included in this ratio the adults must be vetted for GAA activities and have completed safeguarding training for the GAA. Parents are welcome to be included in the party but unless they have completed this process they cannot be included in the ratios. This is essential for children's safety and also to meet our insurance obligations.
        </p>

        <p class="text-left">
            Signed permission slips must be obtained for all children travelling, even if the parent is also travelling. Permission slips and contact details should be retained until the trip is complete
