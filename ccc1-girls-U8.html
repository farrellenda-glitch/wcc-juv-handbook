            CCC1 is the Dublin County Board body responsible for the organisation and administration of the younger juvenile age grades (Under 8 to Under 12) in Dublin GAA. It plays a central role in ensuring that games for children are run in a fair, structured and child-centred way. Under 8 to Under 11 operate on a Go Games blitz basis and graded individual team competitions start at Uunder 12.
