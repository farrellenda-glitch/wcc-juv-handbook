           <strong>Streaming</strong> refers to organising players into teams based on ability when a club has sufficient numbers at a particular age grade. 
           The aim is to provide an appropriate level of challenge, maximise skill development, and ensure competitive games for all participants. 
           Within the Go Games framework teams from Under 9 up are expected to be structured by ability rather than random selection. There is no Streaming at Under 8.
           When you get to Under 12 clubs with multiple teams typically enter them at different divisional levels so players compete against similarly matched opposition.

           Clubs are grouped in Go Games fixtures (Under 8 to Under 11) based on region and number of teams they can field. Clubs that can field 3 teams are grouped together, clubs with 2 teams are grouped together etc. 
           If a club has the numbers it may have a 3 team group plus an additional and 2 or 1 team group. Where this happens the overall groups should be of mixed ability across the board but from Under 9 on the teams within each group are then streamed.

           <strong>I think we should add some guidelines for Streaming in training</strong>
