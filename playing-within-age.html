            We prioritise participation and enjoyment over winning; the aim is many happy juvenile players rather than a few elite teams. 
            Decisions re. Playing Up (both level and age) depend on specific circumstances and mentors should have clear guidelines and explain them to players and parents. 
            County Board rules always apply, certain competitions such as Féile have fixed, named panels. 
            Currently, boys’ competitions allow playing up or down (with fair play expected), while girls’ competitions restrict returning to the original team after playing up a set number of times. 
            Mentors must consider all players fairly, and their decisions should be respected.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-left">
                <li>Juveniles should train and play with their own year group.</li>
                <li>Players may occasionally play one year up if both age-group managers & parents consent while older players are not deprived of game time.</li>
                <li>Players playing up should be rotated, the same individuals should not be relied upon repeatedly.</li>
                <li>If an age group struggles to field multiple teams, creating an additional panel with some younger players may be considered.</li>
                <li>Ongoing support from a younger group (e.g., for B or C teams) should be agreed at the start of the year between mentors and the group coordinator, with formal permission.</li>
                <li>In Camgoie & LGFA players who play up must do so at the same competitive level (e.g., A players at A level, B players at B level).</li>
